            <div class="gameText">
                <p>During Covid, when all regular activities came to a halt, I started coding on Khan Academy more often.
                    What started as a mission to get votes on my program, soon developed into my favorite pastime as I realized that
                     with coding I could invent my own games and be as creative as I want to be which made it both rewarding and 
                     challenging. As I moved from simple graphics, to games, to websites, and apps, I set my own challenges and with
                     each step I learnt more. There are times when I spent hours on what seems like a simple concept and it frustrates
                     and irritates me, but I still love it.
