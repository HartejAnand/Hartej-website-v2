                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>This game has the screen follow the player, allowing the screen to be larger than even the computer's screen size. It also has a player health, which allows the player to sustain more damage rather than die instantly. During the 'earthquake', the screen shakes using the translate function. A sprite forms in the middle, growing until it consumes the hard hat. The game also has different win conditions depending on if you drop diamonds, take damage, ect to make sure you don't see something such as: <u>You got 5 diamonds, you dropped 0 though</u></p>
