                    I was in the First Lego league(FLL) in late elementary school and middle school. The goal of FLL was to make robots
                    out of only lego pieces and a few mechanical pieces (wires, motors). The robot would then have to complete a series
                    of tasks, such as carrying objects from one point of the field to another, turning knobs, and more in under 2
                    minutes.

                    In high school, I joined <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/">VEX robotics</a>, in which we designed larger 
                    robots out of metal parts. We also had to work with random teams to form alliances, and had to try to work together
                    to beat the enemy alliance. In my freshman year, I attended two compititions. We placed 16th the first time, and
                    10th the second time. We qualified for regionals!
